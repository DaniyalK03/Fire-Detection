# Fire-Detection
Machine Learning Mini-Project

A project using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect fire in an imageset of North American Wildfires. The justification of evolving from a Binary classification to Ternary classification is provided via performance comparisons and commentary linking to the original study is given.
